# 2D graphic demo documentation
## How it works
For this assignment, I created a simple graphic of a butterfly. 

## Technology choices
This program was built using the programming language Java. I used a mix of simple graphics that were outlined in the lecture videos, including the methods `fillPolygon()` for the triangles, `drawImage()` for the left side of the butterfly, and `drawString()` for the text. 
> Note: trigger warning for bright, flashing lights/colors. The right wing of the butterfly involves rapidly changing colors.

## How to run
The program is already compiled for you. All you have to do to run it is input the following command:
`java Graphic`

A separate window should open with the graphic being displayed.

## Lessons learned
This assignment actually taught me quite a few things, including, but not limited to:
-	implementation of canvas in Java
-	creating shapes using the Graphics class in Java
-	putting text onto the screen using the Graphics class in Java
-	drawing a saved image using the Graphics class in Java
In my next project, I hope to expand on these principles to learn how to create simple animations.
